# RAMBomber
A program to test your computer's RAM capabilities.

RAM Bomber is a way for you to open multiple windows to test how your computer will react. This information can be interesting to know for RAM-intensive tasks, such as Virtual Machines. It can also be useful to flush memory: once you stop all windows from running, the windows are flushed from RAM, potentially giving you RAM back.

## Notice
RAM Bomber is a harmless tool, however you may be required to hard reset your system if the bombing becomes too much. **Make sure you save any work before you try this tool.**
